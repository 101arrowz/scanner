# scanner

Document scanner prototype in TypeScript. Zero runtime dependencies - all the hard math is done by hand. All the logic is in `src/index.ts`, but it's admittedly a bit hard to read. Around 5kB gzipped for the full app. Very rudimentary demo available [here](https://101arrowz.github.io/scanner/).
